I am working as software engineer for past 4.7 years
Involved in POC of new features and it's implementation in the project assigned to me
Solved productions issues on time and provided RCA to customers
Observed most of the production issues related to scalability as we can't find them while developing functionalities.
Because of this i got interested in learning design patters and started listining the expert's talks and reading open source software
